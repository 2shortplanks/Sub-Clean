=head1 NAME

Sub::Clean - Clean subroutines with an attribute

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Sub::Clean;
  
  sub whatever :Cleaned {
    return "This cannot be called as a method";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module 'cleans' subroutines you mark with the C<Cleaned> attribute,
preventing them being called from places they haven't been already been
bound by the perl compiler.

The main advantage in this is that you can declare subroutines and use them
in your code as functions, but prevent them from being called as a method.
This is particularly useful if your superclass (maybe unbeknownst to you)
has a method of the same name as the function which would normally be
'shadowed' by your method.

For example, this:

  package Banner;
  
  sub text { "example text\n" }
  sub bar  { "-"x20 . "\n" }
  
  sub message {
    my $class = shift;
    return $class->bar . $class->text . $class->bar
  }
  
  package PubBanner;
  use base qw(Banner);
  use Sub::Clean;
  
  sub text { bar() . "\n" }
  
  sub bar :Cleaned { 
    return (("Cheers","Quark's","Moe's")[rand(3)])
  }
  
  package main;
  print PubBanner->message();

Prints out the right thing:

  --------------------
  Moe's
  --------------------

Rather than just printing three horizontal lines.

=head2 Lexical Scope

Please note that this module enables the C<Cleaned> attribute only in lexical
scope of the C<use Sub::Clean> statement.  This prevents namespace pollution.

L<namespace::clean> allows you to clean your namespace by dividing your
code up into sections that should be cleaned or not cleaned.

L<namespace::autoclean> automatically can clean imported subroutines
from other namespaces.

L<Lexical::Sub> allows you to declare subroutines that only exist in
lexical scope.

L<Attribute::Lexical> was used to create lexical attributes.
